The source code for the demand response simulator consists of three core files: an HTML file for the UI, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file implementing game logic and interactivity. These files can be directly placed in a Github repository. Below is a template README file describing the game and the detailed software specs . If you require the full code for each file, please specify which files you want first, or request all.

## README: Demand Response Simulator

# Demand Response Simulator

**Demand Response Simulator** is an interactive web-based game that lets users simulate electricity demand management as a customer or demand aggregator. The objective is to optimize energy costs and provide grid services by strategically responding to dynamic pricing and grid events.

## Game Description

Players step into the role of a residential, commercial, industrial electricity customer or a demand aggregator. By configuring load profiles, choosing demand response technologies, and acting on real-time pricing signals and grid events, players balance economic savings, customer satisfaction, and grid support. The game models key industry pricing mechanisms (TOU, CPP, RTP), compensation rates, and grid value streams.

### Core Features

- **Customer Configuration:** Select customer type, set load profile, configure demand response resources.
- **Pricing Simulation:** Hourly/daily dynamic rates (TOU, Critical Peak, Real-Time Pricing) with color-coded display.
- **Demand Response Capabilities:** Set curtailment amount and technology; see impact on costs and comfort.
- **Event Management:** Respond to demand response signals, grid emergencies, dynamic system conditions.
- **Metric Tracking:** Visualize hourly, daily, cumulative savings; system benefits; comfort/productivity impacts.
- **Gamification:** Achievements, badges, leaderboards, challenge modes for replay value.
- **Educational Tooltips:** Contextual help on market mechanisms, compensation, grid service value.
- **Charts & Visualizations:** Real-time load curves, price signals, cost/saving summaries.

## Software Specifications

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Libraries:** Chart.js for visualizations
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile/tablet/desktop compatible
- **No server required:** Runs completely client-side
- **No build step:** Plain static files, suitable for Github Pages/manual deployment
